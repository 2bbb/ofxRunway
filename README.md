#  ofxRunway
### RunwayML + openFrameworks

[openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) addon that allows you to easily integrate  [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) into your openFrameworks App.
It contains examples on most of the currently available models.

## Install
Download and copy or `git clone` this addon into your openFrameworks addons folder.

Generate or update the example projects by dragging their folder onto the projectGenerator and hitting "update" or "generate".

## Dependencies

You'll need to install the following addons for this addon to work.

* [ofxHTTP](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxHTTP)
* [ofxIO](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIO)
* [ofxMediaType](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxMediaType)
* [ofxNetworkUtils](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxNetworkUtils)
* [ofxSSLManager](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxSSLManager)


## Instructions

Open an example and compile. When running it you must have your RunwayML app running, with the same model as the example in your workspace and running. The examples are named after each model.

For models that ingest images there are usually two examples: one which uses your computers webcam and continously streams frames to RunwayML, and the other one opens an image file and processes it once.


## Explanation

The Runway's app method of communication with other applications is using some network protocol. So far, HTTP is the one implemented.

ofxRunway takes charge of making the needed requests via HTTP on its own thread, as well as receiving the response and processing it when needed; if the response is an image it will decode it and put into an ofImage.

Runway expects to receive and return data in the JSON format.

The particular format for what is sent and received can be queried by calling
`http://localhost:8000/info` which will return a JSON file with the structure for the input and output packages.

You can find the host name as well as the input and output specification of the model you want to run directly in the Runway app. Select your model in the workspace and select Network at the top of the right side bar.

### Clases

ofxRunway has the following classes

#### **ofxRunwayListener**
  * This is an abstract class.
  * The idea is that you extend your `ofApp` class by delcaring it like this
    ```cpp
    class ofApp : public ofBaseApp, public ofxRunwayListener`
    ```
  as well as adding and implementing the following callback functions:
	```cpp
	void runwayInfoEvent(ofJson& info){}
	void runwayErrorEvent(string& message){}
	```
   which will get called whenever needed by `ofxRunway`. You should use this as a mean for communication with `ofxRunway`
  * In order for these callbacks to work you need to setup your `ofxRunway` instance by calling
```cpp
runway.setup(this, "http://localhost:8000");
```
asumming that you are calling it from within `ofApp` and the second parameter is the correct one.




####  **ofxRunway**

  * Is the main class, which is in charge of managing the sending and receiving of data.
  * All the HTTP calls are executed on a different thread, so it wont block your app while waiting for a response.
  *  It includes several handy functions for sending and receiving different data types.
  *  It is designed to be thread safe. You dont need to take care of mutexes.

##### **Public Methods**
######  setup
* Run any of these during setup or if, for some reason, you want to reset the connection during runtime.
* Only use the version with two arguments when you have implemented your class extending `ofxRunwayListener` as described previously.
* You can get the host string from RunwayML app, which is usually defaulted to `"http://localhost:8000"`;

    ```cpp
    bool setup(const string& host);
	 bool setup(ofxRunwayListener& listenerClass, const string& host);
	 bool setup(ofxRunwayListener* listenerClass, const string& host);   
	 ```

######  send
* send an `ofxRunwayData` instance with the necesary data by calling ` void send(ofxRunwayData & data);`
* This will create the call on its own thread, so it wont block your main app.
* There are also the following handy functions to be used when you only need to send a single item.
    ```cpp
    bool send(const string& name, const ofBaseHasPixels& img, ofxRunwayImageType type =OFX_RUNWAY_JPG, int resize_width = 0, int resize_height = 0);
    bool send(const string& name, const ofPixels& pix, ofxRunwayImageType type = OFX_RUNWAY_JPG, int resize_width = 0, int resize_height = 0);
    bool send(const string& name, string& data);
    ```

######  tryReceive
```cpp
bool tryReceive(ofxRunwayData & data);
```

This function will check if there is any new data, and in case of having any and it will move or copy this new data to the `ofxRunwayData` instance you pass to it and will return true. If there is no new data it will return false. It is intended to be called from within your `ofApp::update` function. There is no need to make any other checks or conditions, if there is nothing it will return immediately with very little overhead.

Just like the send methods there are a few handy functions that you can use when expecting a single element to be returned.
```cpp
bool get(const string& name, ofImage& img);
bool get(const string& name, ofPixels& pix);
bool get(const string& name, string& data);
bool get(vector<ofxRunwayCaption>& captions, float imgWidth, float imgHeight);
```

###### Other methods

* `bool isBusy();`

  Will return true if `ofxRunway` has sent a request and is waiting for a response, otherwise will return false;


* `ofxRunwayState getState();`

  Will return the current state of `ofxRunway`. This is a thread-safe function.
 `ofxRunwayState` is an enum which has the following possible values

  * `OFX_RUNWAY_DISCONNECTED` initial default state
  * `OFX_RUNWAY_SETUP` it has been setup but no attempt of getting any data from the runway server has been done
  * `OFX_RUNWAY_CONNECTED`  setup and connected to runway server but no data has been received back
  * `OFX_RUNWAY_RUNNING`  connected and getting data from server
  * `OFX_RUNWAY_CONNECTION_REFUSED` There was an error while trying to connect to server. Probably runway is not running or the workspace in runway is not running.

* `string getStateAsString(bool bVerbose = false);`

  * Will return the status as as string. If you pass `true` as an argument it will return extra info.
  * Used by `drawStatus()`


* `const string& getHost();`
  * Returns the host address.

* `ofRectangle drawStatus(int x = 20, int y = 20,  bool bVerbose = false);`
  * Draws the current status using ofBitmapFont
  * `x` X-axis coordinate where to draw the text
  * `y` y-axiscoordinate where to draw the text
  * `bVerbose` if true draw the verbose (full text) for the current state.
  * returns the bounding box of the text drawn.
* `const ofJson& getInputType(const string& name);`
  * Returns the `ofJson` object with info for the input types with the name passed as an argument.
* `const ofJson& getOutputType(const string& name);`
  * Returns the `ofJson` object with info for the output types with the name passed as an argument.
* `const ofJson& getInputTypes();`
  * Returns the full `ofJson` object with info about the sent data.
* `const ofJson& getOutputTypes();`
  * Returns the full `ofJson` object with info about the received data.

* `bool isServerAvailable();`
  * Returns true if connected to the server.

##### **Public variables**

* `ofEvent<ofJson> infoEvent;`
  * Event triggered when a new info event has arrived. This will happen as soon as `ofxRunway` successfully connects to the Runway app. It will usually only happen once.

* `ofEvent<string> errorEvent;`
  * Event triggered when a there has been an error, either in sending or receiving. The event will contain a string with information about the error.
